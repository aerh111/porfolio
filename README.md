Hi! This is my portfolio for the CMU class "Telling Stories with Data". 

# About Me
My name is Annie, and my pronouns are she/her. I am a part time student in the Master of Public Management program and also work full time at CMU as a finance and research administrator. 

# What I Hope to Learn
My previous experience in data visualization has been mostly limited to Excel graphs, so I am looking forward to discovering more about what is possible in the world of data visualization and increasing my design knowledge and skills. I am unsure exactly what the future holds for me after I graduate, and this program is a time of self discovery for me. I currently work with research grants and contracts, but other areas that I am exploring are non-pofit and arts administration, as well as government work.
